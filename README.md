This project is focused on developing a classic Pong or Breakout-style game using Python. The game includes essential components such as a ball, paddles, and a scoreboard to track the player's score. The main script (main.py) orchestrates the game by initializing and running it, while the supporting files (ball.py, paddle.py, and scoreboard.py) encapsulate specific functionalities.

Components

1) ball.py:

Description: This file contains the Ball class, which handles the properties and behaviors of the ball in the game.
Key Functions:
Initialize the ball's position and velocity.
Update the ball's position based on its velocity.
Detect and respond to collisions with the walls, paddles, and other game elements.

2) main.py:

Description: This is the main script that runs the game. It initializes the game environment and handles the game loop.
Key Functions:
Initialize the game window and game objects (ball, paddles, scoreboard).
Manage the game loop, including player input and game state updates.
Render the game elements and update the display.

3) paddle.py:

Description: This file defines the Paddle class, which manages the player's paddle(s).
Key Functions:
Initialize the paddle's position and size.
Update the paddle's position based on player input.
Detect and respond to collisions with the ball.

4) scoreboard.py:

Description: This file contains the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of and displays the player's score.
Key Functions:
Initialize the scoreboard.
Update the score based on game events.
Display the current score on the screen.
